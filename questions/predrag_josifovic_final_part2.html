				<h2><a href="#">What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</a></h2>
				<p class="text">
					Before starting this course, I&#39;ve had a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and
					JavaScript. This course was a refresher for
					me. I think the next steps would be exploring more advanced topics and create more complex
					and dynamic web projects. As I continue my journey in web development, I wish to deepen my
					understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts. This will involve studying topics such as
					asynchronous programming, closures, and the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, I&#39;m considering exploring a JavaScript framework to streamline the development
					process. Frameworks like React or Angular. My company is currently utilizing Angular.
				</p>

				<h2><a href="#">Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</a></h2>
				<p class="text">
					For the final project I&#39;ve utilized template provided for us. I would love to refactor this and
					make a website portfolio from the scratch. This was the templete that was provided.
					<a href="https://www.simpletemplates.org/" target="_blank">Simple Website Templates</a>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">What was your most challenging part of your portfolio?</a>
				</h2>
				<p class="text">
					The course content was largely a review of familiar topics for me, so I didn&#39;t find it
					particularly difficult. However, if I had to choose one area that presented a bit of a challenge, it
					would be implementing contact form validation with JavaScript and concept of DOM.
				</p>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</a>
				</h2>
				<p class="text">
					I don&#39;t think that it changed my view per se, but it has solidified my understanding of the
					fundamental concepts of web development and encouraged me to further learning. More advanced
					concepts of CSS and Javascript.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</a>
				</h2>
				<p class="text">
					I would recommend, if you&#39;re just starting your journey with Web development, not to skip the
					basics. Even if some topics seem simplistic or are not currently used in modern web development,
					knowing the basics can reinforce your understanding of more complex topics. Continue to practice
					regularly, whether with provided resources, Jon Duckett books or online coding challenges. Stay on
					course, don&#39;t get overwhelmed and taking it step by step.
